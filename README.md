    $ yarn dev

#### To push to device

## Translating

We rely on the community to help us translate texts in the app. For now reach out on Discord and tell us what language 
you can translate to. Later we'll accept pull requests to improve any texts.

Kaiak is currently available in these languages:

* 🇺🇸 [American English](/public/locales/en-US.properties)
* 🇮🇳 [Hindi](/public/locales/hi.properties) – _Thanks_ Rahul Karda
* 🇨🇴 [Colombian Spanish](/public/locales/es-US.properties) – _Thanks_ Alessandro C
* 🇳🇱 [Dutch](/public/locales/nl.properties)
* 🇮🇷 [Farsi](/public/locales/fa.properties) – _Thanks_ Abolfazl Jafari
* 🇧🇷 [Brazilian Portuguese](/public/locales/pt-BR.properties) – _Thanks_ [@marcosbmf](https://github.com/marcosbmf) and [@guil5566](https://github.com/guil5566)

### Add new language

1. Export language from [Traduora](https://traduora.com) as JSON to `/public/locales`
2. Run `$ yarn locales` to transform new language to .properties file, ensure country name is correct.
3. Add to project, and remember to update `manifest.webapp` with `subtitle` and `description`.
